The Smart Home Automation System successfully achieved its goal of providing an efficient and user-friendly solution for remote appliance control and smart energy management. By integrating Arduino Uno, the HC-05 Bluetooth module, relays, and a Java-based desktop application, the system enables users to monitor and optimize their energy consumption effectively.

This project contributes to sustainable energy practices by offering real-time analytics, AI-driven recommendations, and automation capabilities. The system enhances convenience, reduces energy waste, and promotes cost-effective energy consumption. Furthermore, it aligns with the broader Smart City Initiative by introducing intelligent home automation solutions.

While the project has demonstrated strong performance, future work may focus on integrating additional IoT capabilities, cloud-based data storage, and advanced AI algorithms for even more efficient energy management. The implementation of a mobile application for greater accessibility and an internet-based control mechanism could further improve the systemâ€™s usability and functionality.
